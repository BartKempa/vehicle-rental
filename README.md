# VehicleRental

**Training project VehicleRental** is a "clean" Java application for vehicle rental.  
The main purpose of creating it was to learn fundamental Java concepts, including:  

- Data types and variables  
- Object-oriented programming  
- Arrays and collections  
- Methods and functions  
- Exception handling  
- File handling  

It is a console-based application that does not use any frameworks.  
The project was developed without any external libraries to focus purely on core Java features.
